Within each clerkship, students are assessed in a variety of ways. Student performance evaluations (SPEs) are completed by the physicians they work with in the clinical setting. Each student is evaluated by multiple physicians, with an average score calculated across all SPEs. The students also complete an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) at the end of each clerkship where students are assessed by Standardized Patients (SPs) in various simulated patient encounters. Each SP is trained to portray a patient in a clinical setting with a specific chief complaint. At the end of the encounter, the SP completes a checklist on a variety of history and physical exam skills. Each clerkship OSCE has between 2-5 encounters that all students rotate through. Scores are calculated for each encounter and summarized as an overall OSCE score. In addition, students complete a multiple-choice National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam at the end of each clerkship.

I will merge these data sets into a new ‘Grades’ data set, where each row will contain all student scores for one clerkship. In other words, each student will have seven (or fewer) rows of data (one for each clerkship they completed).\nI will start by loading the following libraries.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(summarytools)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggh4x)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n\nData Set #1: Read in and view summary of ‘FinalGrades’ data set.

This excel file contains one worksheet.\n\nComponentGrades &lt;- read_excel (\"AY1920-AY2122_ComponentGrades.xlsx\")\n\nThe ‘ComponentGrades’ dataset contains 3334 rows and 9 columns (including academic year, student ID, subject area, catalog number, session, location, as well as SPE, OSCE, and NBME scores).\nFrom the data summary, I can see that the SPE scores are on a 4-point scale whereas the OSCE, NBME, and final numeric scores are on a 0-100% score. I will recode the SPE scores to be on a 0-100% score to make them more comparable.\n\nComponentGrades &lt;- ComponentGrades %&gt;%\n  mutate (SPE_new=SPE_Score/4 * 100)"

I will also look at this comparison within the individual clerkships as well as across gender and ethnic groups. Our ethnicity categories are based on those used by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), as we have to submit data on an annual basis to this national organization.\nMultiple sites are needed to accommodate the number of students enrolled in each clerkship, therefore we are also interested in examining the data at the site level to determine if students are performing similarly regardless of what site they are assigned to.\n\nAnswering the 3rd question will assist in responding to the medical school’s accrediting body’s (Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME)) mandate that student experiences across various sites within the same clerkship should be similar."

As I page through the above data, I can see that the majority of the students with missing data are from AY1920, during the last session of the year (e.g., 3C3, 3C5, etc.). That is when the COVID pandemic first affected the medical students’ clinical rotations. Student rotations during this time period were modified due to hospital/clinic restrictions and therefore they were graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory scale instead of the typical grading scale of High Honors (HH), Honors (S), Pass (P), Fail (F). Students given a Satisfactory letter grade will be missing a final grade numeric score, as well as many, if not all, grading component scores for that rotation. Because of this, I will filter out all ‘S’ letter grades to see how many others have NAs.\n\nGrades[!complete.cases(Grades), ] %&gt;%\n  filter(FinalGrade_Letter != \"S\") %&gt;%\n  select(AcadYear, Subject, Catalog.x, Session.x, FinalGrade_Letter, FinalGrade_Numeric, SPE_new, OSCE_Score, NBME_Score)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nI am now seeing that there are still 122 rows with one or more NAs. As I review the data in this table, I am reminded that the students in one of the longer clerkships (medicine or surgery) during the last few blocks of the academic year when the pandemic first started, were given an actual letter grade of HH/H/P vs. a Satisfactory grade, for the part of the clerkship they completed prior to the restrictions being put into place, however those students don’t all have component scores for the exams and OSCEs that should’ve taken place at the end of the rotation; therefore, I will exclude those rows as well. The remaining 16 rows are from AY2021 and AY2122, but because this data was obtained from the various clerkship administrators, I am unable to explain why they are missing one or more grades; therefore, I will exclude those as well.\nBased on the above reviews, all NAs can be excluded; the following code will re-run the descriptive statistics excluding NAs.\n\nGrades %&gt;%\n  group_by(AcadYear, Subject) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n_FINAL = sum(!is.na(FinalGrade_Numeric)),\n            Avg_FINAL = mean(FinalGrade_Numeric, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Min_FINAL = min(FinalGrade_Numeric, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Max_FINAL = max(FinalGrade_Numeric, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n_SPE = sum(!is.na(SPE_new)),\n            Avg_SPE = mean(SPE_new, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Min_SPE = min(SPE_new, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Max_SPE = max(SPE_new, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n_OSCE = sum(!is.na(OSCE_Score)),\n            Avg_OSCE = mean(OSCE_Score, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Min_OSCE = min(OSCE_Score, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Max_OSCE = max(OSCE_Score, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n_NBME = sum(!is.na(NBME_Score)),\n            Avg_NBME = mean(NBME_Score, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Min_NBME = min(NBME_Score, na.rm=TRUE),\n            Max_NBME = max(NBME_Score, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  print(n=21)\n\n# A tibble: 21 × 18\n# Groups:   AcadYear [3]\n   AcadYear Subject n_FINAL Avg_FINAL Min_FINAL Max_FINAL n_SPE Avg_SPE Min_SPE\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AY1920   FC          139      91.3      78.4      97.0   140    94.1    71.5\n 2 AY1920   ME          160      86.7      64        99.9   108    87.3    70.5\n 3 AY1920   NU          126      84.9      65        98.8   143    85.9    52  \n 4 AY1920   OB          172      83.4      66.0      98.5   153    86.7    57.8\n 5 AY1920   PE          142      79.1      57.8      98.2   142    81.1    57  \n 6 AY1920   PS          137      87.8      76.8      96.5   134    89.3    70  \n 7 AY1920   SU          168      80        40       100     136    88.7    65.8\n 8 AY2021   FC          166      92.6      82.9      97.9   165    94.8    81.4\n 9 AY2021   ME          161      85.8      67.8      99     161    89.0    74.2\n10 AY2021   NU          160      84.8      65        99.6   162    86.9    58.2\n11 AY2021   OB          164      83.8      69.8      94.8   164    88.8    66.7\n12 AY2021   PE          162      81.6      57.6      98.4   162    81.3    50.5\n13 AY2021   PS          159      89.3      77.9      96.1   158    91.4    65  \n14 AY2021   SU          163      84.4      60       100     164    90.6    69  \n15 AY2122   FC          150      92.9      80.6      98.6   150    95.8    84.2\n16 AY2122   ME          152      86.2      54        99.2   153    88.4    77  \n17 AY2122   NU          150      84.1      66        99.2   152    86.7    68.8\n18 AY2122   OB          156      84.8      69.2      96.0   157    89.2    71.1\n19 AY2122   PE          149      85.9      67.7      98.1   149    86.3    71.2\n20 AY2122   PS          160      89.5      77.8      96.6   160    92.6    74  \n21 AY2122   SU          154      85.4      60       100     158    90.7    69  \n# ℹ 9 more variables: Max_SPE &lt;dbl&gt;, n_OSCE &lt;int&gt;, Avg_OSCE &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Min_OSCE &lt;dbl&gt;, Max_OSCE &lt;dbl&gt;, n_NBME &lt;int&gt;, Avg_NBME &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Min_NBME &lt;dbl&gt;, Max_NBME &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Question 2\nQuestion #2: How do component scores compare to final numeric scores at the aggregate level, clerkship level, and across gender and ethnic groups?\nTo do this, I will need to pivot the wide data to long so that each row only contains one score.\n\nGrades_long&lt;-pivot_longer(Grades, col = c(FinalGrade_Numeric, OSCE_Score, NBME_Score, SPE_new),\n                 names_to= \"ScoreType\",\n                 values_to = \"value\")\n\nThe pivot_long data set contains 13,404 rows and 15 columns.\nThe following line graph will provide average scores by AcadYear and ScoreType.\n\nGrades_long &lt;- Grades_long %&gt;%\n  separate(ScoreType, c(\"ScoreType1\", \"ScoreType2\"), \"_\")\n\nGrades_long %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = AcadYear, y = value, group = ScoreType1, color=ScoreType1)) +    stat_summary(geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean) +\n   labs(title = \"Comparison of Component Scores to Final Numeric Scores\", y=\"Percent\", x = \"\", color=\"Score Type\") + \n   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the Score Types is looking greater than it really is b/c the y-axis scale is 77.5-100; therefore, I will re-run forcing the scale to display 0-100 at 20 point increments.\n\nGrades_long %&gt;%\n ggplot(aes(x = AcadYear, y = value, group = ScoreType1, color=ScoreType1)) +    stat_summary(geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean) +\n   labs(title = \"Comparison of Component Scores to Final Numeric Scores\", y=\"Percent\", x = \"\", color=\"Score Type\") + \n   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in the above graph that all 4 scores are very comparable, however further analysis could be conducted to determine if one grading component is better than another at predicting final clerkship scores.\nThe following line graphs will again show average scores by AcadYear and ScoreType, but this time stratified by clerkship, gender and ethnicity. I will exclude gender code ‘U’ and two ethnicities (“American Indian and Alaska Native” and “Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander”) due to very small numbers of students in each of those groups.\n\nGrades_long %&gt;%\n ggplot(aes(x = AcadYear, y = value, group = ScoreType1, color=ScoreType1)) +    \n  stat_summary(geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean) +\n   labs(title = \"Comparison of Component Scores to Final Numeric Scores \\n By Clerkship\", y=\"Percent\", x = \"\", color=\"Score Type\") + \n   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +\n   facet_wrap(~factor(Subject), ncol=3) +\n   scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Grades_long %&gt;%\n    filter(Gender != \"U\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = AcadYear, y = value, group = ScoreType1, color=ScoreType1)) + \n    stat_summary(geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean) +\n    labs(title = \"Comparison of Component Scores to Final Numeric Scores \\n By Gender\", y=\"Percent\", x = \"\", color=\"Score Type\") + \n   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +\n   facet_wrap(~factor(Gender)) +\n   scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Grades_long %&gt;%\n   filter(Ethnicity != \"American Indian or Alaska Native\" & Ethnicity != \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\") %&gt;%\n      ggplot(aes(x = AcadYear, y = value, group = ScoreType1, color=ScoreType1)) + \n   stat_summary(geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean) +\n   labs(title = \"Comparison of Component Scores to Final Numeric Scores \\n By Ethnicity\", y=\"Percent\", x = \"\", color=\"Score Type\") + \n   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +\n   facet_wrap(~factor(Ethnicity), ncol=2) +\n   scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gender and ethnicity data is following a similar pattern as the final numeric scores, such that SPE are the highest, followed by final numeric, then OSCEs, with NBME having the lowest averages. The clerkship graphs are showing a bit more variability, but again, with all scores roughly in the high 70s to high 80s range, even though one component is averaging lower or higher than another doesn’t mean they are statistically different; further analysis would be needed to determine that."

For example, NU, OB, and PE look pretty similar across most locations, however FC and PS tend to have more variation from location to location. Further analysis would be needed to determine if we are in compliance with LCME standards. We would also look at grading component scores by location to see if students at particular locations are more (or less) prepared for OSCEs and/or NBME exams. We would also be able to determine if physicians at certain locations are stricter (or more lenient) with their grading on SPEs than other locations which would outline where more faculty development may be needed.\nIn conclusion, it seems that while more analysis is definitely needed, there weren’t any glaring issues with consistency from year to year or location to location that really stood out. This type of analysis is done on an annual basis as it is important to let academic leaders at our institution know if we start to notice any negative trends with respect to gender or ethnicity inequalities that need to be addressed immediately, etc. In addition, as we onboard new locations for our clerkship students to rotate at, we pay particular attention to their data as we may need to reach out to those locations to offer additional support and resources for implementing our curriculum so their students are performing similarly to students at other locations.\n\ncitation()\n\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2022).
