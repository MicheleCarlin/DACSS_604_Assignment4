## Goals
My short-term goal is to complete the DACSS program this December, as I know the research design and statistical knowledge I have gained will greatly assist me in furthering my career at UMass Chan.

## Education
Fitchburg State University<br>
BS in Psychology, 1998

## Experience
I have been working at UMass Chan Medical School for the past 25 years in the Office of Institutional Research, Evaluation, and Assessment (IREA).  
We oversee the creation, distribution, and reporting of student program evaluations, the scoring of medical and nursing school examinations, and we report out on 90+ institutional research (IR) surveys to ensure compliance with the UMass Presidentâ€™s Office and other external regulatory agencies which involves the gathering and analyzing of data for comparative and benchmark purposes.
